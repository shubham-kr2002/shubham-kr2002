   “Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else ... Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.”

Hi there, I'm shubham kumar 👋
### AI Engineer & RAG Architect | Building High-Precision Legal & Automation Systems

I build **production-grade AI systems** using First Principles thinking. My focus is on pushing the boundaries of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and orchestrating multi-agent LLM workflows to solve complex, domain-specific problems.

Currently, I am engineering **semantic search engines for the Indian Legal System** and automating high-friction workflows.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Arsenal

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **GenAI & LLMs** | OpenAI (GPT-4o/5.x), Claude (Opus/Sonnet), LangChain, RAG Architectures, Vector Embeddings |
| **Backend & Data** | Python, Semantic Chunking (Regex/NLP), Streamlit, Vector Databases |
| **Dev Environment** | Cursor, Windsurf, Docker, Git |
| **Methodology** | First Principles Thinking, Pareto Optimization (80/20), Agentic Workflows |

## 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy: "The Architect & The Builder"
I believe in **Zero-Error Architecture**. I utilize a dual-phase AI development workflow:
1.  **Deep Planning:** Leveraging high-reasoning models (like Claude Opus) to draft extensive architectural plans (`plan.md`) and function contracts.
2.  **Precision Execution:** Using efficient coding models (like Claude Sonnet) to implement logic step-by-step, ensuring strict adherence to the architectural plan.

> *"We don't just write code; we defeat complexity through structural clarity."*
